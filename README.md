##Monthly Readers Club

Monthly Readers Club is an "education" company that I started.  It's based upon the idea that we can improve ourselves through reading.  The site features 2 different subscriptions: genre based and business courses.  In each, the customer receives a book each month based upon the preferences selected.

This repo is the template used on the cratejoy.com website.  It's a heavily customized version of the booksea template from cratejoy.
